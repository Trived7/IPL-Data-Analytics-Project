# IPL 2024 Data Analytics Project

<strong><h2>Project Overview📌</h2></strong><br>
This is a team-based end‑to‑end Data Analytics project analyzing IPL 2024 match data.
The project demonstrates how raw sports data can be transformed into meaningful insights and predictive analysis using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

<strong><h2>Project Objectives🎯</h2></strong><br>
  • Analyze team performance and match results

  • Study toss impact on match outcomes

  • Identify top performing players

  • Examine venue-based scoring trends

  • Build a basic Machine Learning model to predict match winners

<strong><h2>🛠️Tools & Technologies Used:</h2></strong>
  • SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL) – Data cleaning & querying

  • Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit‑learn) – EDA & Machine Learning

  • Power BI – Interactive dashboard & business visualization

<h2>GitHub – Version control & collaboration</h2>
